Things to help develop in node.js:
Install Live-Server, whether it is through an extention or through installing Node.js and then opening the terminal and typing 'npm install live-server -g'.

Putting 2 arrays together: array1.concat(array2).

Debugging:
console.table() will put an array in a table. This helps in debugging objects

Can also use the 'Sources' Tab in Google chrome and this allows you to drop breakpoints and such.
